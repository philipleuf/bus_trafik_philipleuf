### SBAB React Typescript, fetch buslines, merge data and present the top 10 list



I use function theFunc to scope functions and use them in useEffect before they are defined

and use anonymous arrowfunctions 'const theFunc () => {} for small oneliner helper functions

extracted logic from components for easier readability and testing

data is cached, clean cache in browser if you get any errors or want to try fetch function
